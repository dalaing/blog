There are websites that allow you to play boardgames online, for free.

Here are a few to consider:
- [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/join) 
- [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en/)

I'm planning a recurring Zoom call to allow people to come together, find other people to play with, recommend various games to play etc...
The current plan is to schedule the call from 9am-9pm on Saturdays and Sundays, but I can open that up if people want.

The meeting details will appear here once I get things set up.
