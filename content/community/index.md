I'm trying to generate ideas for community activities, so we can stay connected to each other, have some fun, and just generally be there for each other.

If you have more ideas to add to the list, let me know! If you want to suggest a change to the schedule, let me know!  If you want to idly chat with someone, let me know!  My email is dave.laing.80@gmail.com, and I'm fairly available these days.

## Calendar

All of these events occur over [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).  You can join from your browser or from the application.  The details of the various calls are in the calendar entries:

## Daily check-in

We go around the group once, and talk about how we feel at the moment, along with "something else", taking a minute or two each, and then naming the next person to go.  I'll change "something else" each day.

I've pencilled in a time that works for the largest number people, based on a survey that I sent out.  If that time doesn't work for a big enough group of people, I'll put together a second session - let me know if that is you or it won't happen.

## Gratitude journaling

There is some good looking evidence that maintaining a gratitude journal boosts happiness.  That seems like a good thing, let's do that.

We'd be filling out entries based on two prompts that would be the same every day:

- I am grateful for _ because _
  - We are aiming for one to three entries for this one.
- What am I looking forward to tomorrow?

and a third prompt that would change from day to day.

Some tips:

- Ideally, we'll be writing these down with pen/pencil and paper, because there is a good chance that works better than typing it into a device.
- Thinking ahead to what you're going to write ahead of time isn't cheating, it is encourage, because it means you're thinking in terms of gratitude throughout the day.

The idea is to do this quietly as a group, in the hope that having a similar set of people turning up for this every day helps with habit formation.  If there is time at the end and people feel like sharing some of their entries, we'll do some of that as well.

## Reading a book together

The plan is to each take a turn reading for the night and aim to either finish a chapter or read for 30-45 minutes, whichever happens sooner.

I've got two suggestions below, but I'm up for anything that we can all get our hands on.

These suggestions are both _long_, which is intentional.  Pulling a fairly stable group of people regularly over the course of this pandemic seems valuable in terms of helping people feel supported and connected, and I figured long books would keep people coming back.  I'm also up for a bunch of shorter books if that is what people are into.

### Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR)

Available [here](http://www.hpmor.com/).
Also available in audiobook form [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56) if you fall behind and want to catch up.

Harry Potter fan-fiction, where Harry was raised on a healthy dose of the scientific method, science fiction and logic.  The other characters all behave rationally as well, although they mostly don't have Harry's background.

This is probably not one to include the kids with, it has some more adult stuff in there.

We could also assign people to characters and run it like a radio play - although I think we'd want to take turns with the narration.

### The Count of Monte Cristo

Available [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184).

It is a classic for a reason, and is less dark than HPMOR.

## Show and tell

What is says on the tin.  One of us talks about something they find interesting, and then we all chat about it for a while.

If you have something you want to present, reach out to me and I'll add it to the calendar.  If no one has stuff in the calendar on any given week, then we can either have that night off or just hang out together.

## Authentic Relating

[This](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/11/the-club-where-you-bare-your-soul-to-strangers/545786/) is a good overview of what it is all about.
[This](https://www.brisbaneauthentics.com/) is the Brisbane version of it.

There is a decent chance that if you're on this page you already know about it, and even better chance that you'll end up meeting people from this group if you are doing anything on this page.

## Weekend boardgames

There are websites that allow you to play boardgames online, for free.

Here are a couple:

- [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/join) 
- [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en/)

The idea is that people will be drop in when they have time.  If you are keen to hang out with someone and no one else is currently in the room, maybe consider hanging around for a little while in case other people show up.  I'll try to drum up enough interest to keep things buzzing.

I'm able to create breakout rooms for people to chat in while they are playing games, or for those who want to have side discussion etc... We'll all work it out as we go.  I'm also considering getting a premium account on Board Game Arena so we can play more games / have more control over the whole experience.

## Rationality reading group

I've done some stuff with a subset of the Berkeley rationalist community, and I think they've got some very useful tools in their belts.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is meant to give people a taste for that.  The [CFAR workshops](https://rationality.org/workshops/upcoming) are more directly aimed at teaching people applicable tools in this space, and they are awesome.  Sara Ness from the Authentic Relating movement has a few posts on her experience with the Rationalist folks [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/rationalists-and-8403545) and [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/rationality-15187409).

The primary aim of this group is to read through one of the following collections of posts and have discussions about them.

The secondary aim, if folks are keen for it, is to talk about and practice using some of the CFAR tools to improve on those discussions.

### Rationality: From AI to Zombies

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality).

This is a pretty deep dive into the what and why of rationality, from the perspective of someone who got interested in the topic via thinking about AI and AI safety really hard.  There is plenty to think about and discuss along the way.

### The Codex

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/codex).

It is shorter, lighter, and might be a bit more fun for a read along, but I think I'd like to try for a Rationality:A-Z group first.
