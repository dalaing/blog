I'm trying to generate ideas for community activities, so we can stay connected to each other, have some fun, and just generally be there for each other.

If you have more ideas to add to the list, let me know!

## Calendar

## Daily check-in

We go around the group once, and talk about how we feel at the moment, along with "something else", taking a minute or two each, and then naming the next person to go.
I'll change "something else" each day.

I've pencilled in a time that works for the largest number people, based on a survey that I sent out.  
If that time doesn't work for a big enough group of people, I'll put together a second session - let me know if that is you or it won't happen.

## Gratitude journalling

TODO

The idea is to do this quietly as a group, in the hope that having a similar set of people turning up for this every day helps with habit formation.
If there is time at the end and people feel like sharing some of their entries, we'll do some of that as well.

## Reading a book together

The plan is to each take a turn reading for the night and aim to either finish a chapter or read for 30-45 minutes, whichever happens sooner.

I've got two suggestions below, but I'm up for anything that we can all get our hands on.

These suggestions are both _long_, which is intentional.
Pulling a fairly stable group of people regularly over the course of this pandemic seems valuable in terms of helping people feel supported and connected, and I figured long books would keep people coming back.
I'm also up for a bunch of shorter books if that is what people are into.

### Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (HPMOR)

Available [here](http://www.hpmor.com/).
Also available in audiobook form [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56) if you fall behind and want to catch up.

Harry Potter fan-fiction, where Harry was raised on a healthy dose of the scientific method, science fiction and logic.
The other characters all behave rationally as well, although they mostly don't have Harry's background.

This is probably not one to include the kids with, it has some more adult stuff in there.

We could also assign people to characters and run it like a radio play - although I think we'd want to take turns with the narration.

### The Count of Monte Cristo

Availble [here](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184).

It is a classic for a reason, and is less dark than HPMOR.

## Weekend boardgames

There are websites that allow you to play boardgames online, for free.

Here are a few to consider:

- [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/join) 
- [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en/)

Some folks are also keen on [Tabeltop Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/).

I have a recurring [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) call to help people to come together, find other people to play with, recommend various games to play etc...

At the moment I have the [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) call scheduled to go from 9 AM - midnight (Brisbane time, AKA UTC+10) on weekends, so that people can just drop in whenever and hang out:

- for those joining from a browser, the link is [https://us04web.zoom.us/j/429711127?pwd=NE00SXI3Tlc3QzBqYzRLSmdjdnh6Zz09](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/429711127?pwd=NE00SXI3Tlc3QzBqYzRLSmdjdnh6Zz09)
- for those joining from the app, the Meeting ID is 429 711 127 and the Password is 767668

The idea is that people will be dropping in and dropping out when they have time, so if you are keen to hang out with someone and noone else is currently in the room, maybe consider hanging around for a little while in case other people show up.  I'll try to drum up enough interest to keep things buzzing, but we'll have to see how that goes.

While I'm around on the call I should be able to create breakout rooms for people who want to have side discussion etc... We'll all work it out as we go.

## Rationality reading group

TODO

### Rationality: From AI to Zombies

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality).

For those who like their rationality with a non-fiction flavour.  There is plenty to think about and discuss along the way.

### The Codex

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/codex).

It is shorter, lighter, and might be a bit more fun for a read along, but I think I'd like to try for a Rationality:A-Z group first.
