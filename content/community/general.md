I'm trying to generate ideas for community activities, so we can stay connected to each other, have some fun, and just generally be there for each other.

If you have more ideas to add to the list, let me know!

## Boardgames

There are websites that allow you to play boardgames online, for free.

Here are a few to consider:

- [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/join) 
- [Yucata](https://www.yucata.de/en/)

I have a recurring Zoom call to allow people to come together, find other people to play with, recommend various games to play etc...

The call is scheduled from 9am-midnight on Saturdays and Sundays, but I can open that up if people want.

The meeting details are:

- for those joining from a browser, the link is https://us04web.zoom.us/j/429711127?pwd=NE00SXI3Tlc3QzBqYzRLSmdjdnh6Zz09
- for those joining from the app, the Meeting ID is 429 711 127 and the Password is 767668

## Book club

The plan would be to read a chapter every couple of days, and to have a half hour call twice a week to discuss the chapter that we all read.

I'm considering setting this up for the following books, although I'm open to suggestions.

I'll schedule the calls once we have 3 or more people interested and willing to chip away at these for a while.

### Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

Available [here](http://www.hpmor.com/) or in audiobook form [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56)

Harry Potter fan-fiction, where Harry was raised on a healthy dose of the scientific method, science fiction and logic.
The other characters all behave rationally as well, although they mostly don't have Harry's background.

This is probably not one to include the kids with, it has some more adult stuff in there.

### Rationality: From AI to Zombies

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality).

For those who like their rationality with a non-fiction flavour.  There is plenty to think about and discuss along the way.

[The Codex](https://www.lesswrong.com/codex) is shorter, lighter, and might be a bit more fun for a read along, but I think I'd like to try for a Rationality:A-Z group first.
