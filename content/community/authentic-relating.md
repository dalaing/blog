The idea is to have a bunch of Zoom calls scheduled so that people from the community can drop it any time and chat with each other.

I'll start with one call.

If it gets crowded and I'm in the room, I should be able to press some buttons and set up some breakout rooms for smaller, more manageable conversations.

If it gets crowded and I'm not in the room, let me know and I'll add some more meetings, so folks can jump between rooms and try to balance things out at a manageable number of people per room.

I'll keep this page up to date with the details of the various calls.

I'm also putting together some more [general](./general.html) community activities as well.
