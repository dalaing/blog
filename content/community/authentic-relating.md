The idea is to have a of Zoom call scheduled so that people from the community can drop it any time and chat with each other.

If it gets crowded and I'm in the room, I should be able to press some buttons and set up some breakout rooms for smaller, more manageable conversations.

If it gets crowded and I'm not in the room, let me know and I'll add some more meetings, so folks can jump between rooms and try to balance things out at a manageable number of people per room.

I'll keep this page up to date with the details of the various calls.

At the moment I have the call scheduled to go from 5PM - 10PM on weeknights, so that people can just drop in whenever and hang out.
