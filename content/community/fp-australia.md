The idea is to have a bunch of Zoom calls scheduled so that people from the community can drop it any time and chat with each other.

I'll start with one call, but I'll add some more later if there is high demand, so we can jump between rooms and try to balance things out at a manageable number of people per room.
I'm thinking that probably translates to around 5 people per room on average.
I'll keep this page up to date with the details of the various calls.

I'm also putting together some more [general](./general.html) community activities as well.
