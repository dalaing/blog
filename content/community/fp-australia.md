The idea is to have a Zoom call scheduled regularly so that people from the community can drop it any time and chat with each other.

If it gets crowded and I'm in the room, I should be able to press some buttons and set up some breakout rooms for smaller, more manageable conversations.

If it gets crowded and I'm not in the room, let me know and I'll add some more meetings, so folks can jump between rooms and try to balance things out at a manageable number of people per room.

I'll keep this page up to date with the details of the various calls.

At the moment I have the call scheduled to go from 5 PM - 10 PM (Brisbane time, AKA UTC+10) on weeknights, so that people can just drop in whenever and hang out:

- for those joining from the app, the Meeting ID is 961 078 239 and the Password is 438948

The idea is that people will be dropping in and dropping out when they have time, so if you are keen to hang out with someone and noone else is currently in the room, maybe consider hanging around for a little while in case other people show up.  I'll try to drum up enough interest to keep things buzzing, but we'll have to see how that goes.

I'm also putting together some more [general](./general.html) community activities as well.
