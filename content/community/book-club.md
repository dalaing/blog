The plan would be to read a chapter every couple of days, and to have a half hour call twice a week to discuss the chapter that we all read.

I'm considering setting this up for the following books, although I'm open to suggestions.

I'll schedule the calls once we have 3 or more people interested and willing to chip away at these for a while.

## Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

Available [here](http://www.hpmor.com/) or in audiobook form [here](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56)

## Rationality: From AI to Zombies

Available [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality).

For those who like their rationality with a non-fiction flavour.
